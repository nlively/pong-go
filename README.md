This project is my simplistic take on the Pong game.

It uses the ebiten Go 2D library to render the graphics and provide the basic game loop.

Mostly doing this for fun and to get my head around the math.

The goal is to write it here and then port it to a few other languages to normalize the process.  We'll see how that goes :)
